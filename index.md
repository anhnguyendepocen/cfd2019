# Textbooks with Jupyter and Jekyll

This repository / website is a template for hosting your own textbook using
Jekyll and Jupyter Notebooks. All course content is written in markdown and
Jupyter Notebooks, and a set of helper scripts converts these notebooks into
Jekyll-based markdown fit for hosting on the web.

This repository comes with some sample textbook files from the Data 8 course
for Data Science at UC Berkeley. You can update these materials and all site
content with your own, and have a Jupyter-based textbook ready to go shortly!
