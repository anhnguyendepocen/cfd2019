# Day 13 (the fourteenth day)

## Announcements

*   A reminder about the updated [project schedule](../project)
*   From {% cite millman2018rcsds %}:

    In answer to "What advice would you give to another student who is considering taking this course?":

    > Unlike most group projects (which last for maybe a few weeks
    > tops or could conceivably be pulled off by one very dedicated
    > person), this one will dominate the entire semester. . . . Try
    > to stay organized for the project and create lots of little
    > goals and checkpoints. You should always be working on something
    > for the project, whether that's coding, reviewing, writing, etc.
    > Ask lots of questions and ask them early!
