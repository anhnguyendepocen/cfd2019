This course has a rather different focus from many introductory courses to
Python. Typical courses in Python are for people who want to learn
"programming" in the abstract, and there are some very good books and online
courses for this; see below for some suggestions.

## Python for scientific data analysis

This course concentrates on using Python for data analysis, so it has a strong
focus on the libraries that you need to get, select, visualize and analyze
data. Unlike many courses on Python and data analysis, this course does not
assume you have done any programming before. As yet there are no good printed
books that we know if, that follow this scheme.  For online material, the
[Berkeley course in data science](https://www.inferentialthinking.com) is
a very good introduction, that proceeds at a faster pace that we do.  You'll
see that we have used a lot of their material for this course.  The [Software
Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) organization has good online lessons
that introduce various tools for using code in science, including an
[introduction to
Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation), although this
lesson goes a lot faster than we do. If you want a set of online materials for
using the scientific libraries, that does assume some background in using
Python, try the [Scipy Lectures](https://scipy-lectures.org).   If you know
Python reasonably well, and you need an introduction to data science for
Python, then [Jake VanderPlas'](http://vanderplas.com) [Python data science
handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook) is a good
resource.  It is very clear, well-written, and up to date, but it is not
suitable for a beginner in Python.

## Python programming in general

You will find many good free online resources for learning Python programming
in general.

Please consider the online textbook [Think Like a Computer
Scientist](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook); it is
well-written, and had gone through several versions, so the material is well
tested.

We have no up-to-date recommendations for print books on Python; if you have
a suggestion, please pass it on.
