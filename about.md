## About the *Data Science for Everyone* textbook

This is the textbook for the course "Data Science for Everyone" at the
University of Birmingham.

The course is a "Widening Horizons Module", meaning that it is a course
intended for students of any discipline.  The course covers some basic
programming and uses some very basic mathematics, but you do not need to have
any previous experience in programming, or great interest / ability in
mathematics.

Parts of the course use the material from the [excellent
textbook](https://www.inferentialthinking.com) for Berkeley's course
[Foundations of Data Science](http://data8.org).
