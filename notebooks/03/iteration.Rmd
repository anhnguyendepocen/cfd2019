### Iteration ###

It is often the case in programming – especially when dealing with randomness
– that we want to repeat a process multiple times.

We know the numpy function `random.randint` claims to choose randomly
between the integers in the range we specify.

We have been choosing randomly between 0 and 1 with:

```{python}
coin = np.random.randint(2)
coin
```

We might want to check this really does in fact pick 0 or 1 with
about the same probability.  To do that, we could start by running
the following cell many times to see if we get roughly equal numbers of
0 and 1.

```{python}
np.random.randint(2)
```

We might want to re-run code with slightly different input or other slightly
different behavior. We could copy-paste the code multiple times, but that's
tedious and prone to typos, and if we wanted to do it a thousand times or
a million times, forget it.

A more automated solution is to use a `for` statement to loop over the
contents of a sequence. This is called *iteration*. A `for` statement begins
with the word `for`, followed by a name we want to give each item in the
sequence, followed by the word `in`, and ending with an expression that
evaluates to a sequence. The indented body of the `for` statement is executed
once *for each item in that sequence*.

```{python}
for i in np.arange(3):
    print(i)
```

## The idea behind a for loop

The for loop takes a sequence of things (in our case, the sequence 0, 1, 2), and, for each element in the sequence, it does some task.   The task is the indented part of the for loop, also called the *body* of the for loop.

This is a common pattern where we take a series of things, and perform the
same steps on each.  For example, imagine a librarian describing the sequence
of steps that he goes through, in issuing a stack of books.  He might say
something like:

    For each **book** in (the stack of books to issue):
        Open **book** to first page
        Stamp first page of **book**
        Close **book**
        Hand **book** to reader.

Imagine a passport control officer describing their work:

    For each **person** of (the people in the immigration line):
        Ask **person** for their passport.
        Check passport photo against face of **person**.
        Scan passport to check against database.
        Return passport to **person**.
        Allow **person** through to customs.

In either case, we take a sequence of things (books, people), and for each
element in that sequence (each book, each person) we perform a task (issuing
the book, checking the person's passport).  We have indented the steps of
task that we perform for each (book, person); this is the *task definition*.  In the for loop, the task definition is also called the *body* of the for loop.

In the loops above, we did something with each element in the sequence.  Fir the first loop, the element is one book. The librarian opened, stamped, moved the book.  In the second loop, the element is a person in the immigration line; the officer takes their passport and checks it, and then allows them through.

This is not always the case - sometimes we just want to repeat some action a set amount of times.  For example, when you go on a flight, you may see a member of the cabin crew going through the cabin, clicking a clicker for each passenger.  This is to count the number of passengers.  That loop might be:

    For each **passenger** of the (passengers in the aircraft):
        Press the clicker

Notice that the body of the loop is "Press the clicker", but that doesn't involve the particular **passenger**.  The loop, here, is just a way of repeating the same action multiple times.

## Unrolling the loop

Here is the actual Python for loop.

```{python}
for i in np.arange(3):
    print(i)
```

We can read that as:

    For each value in the sequence `np.arange(3)`:
        Put the value into the variable `i`
        Execute the statement `print(i)`.

* `i` is the *loop variable*;
* `np.arange(3)` is the *sequence*;
* `print(i)` is the *body* of the loop.

It is instructive to imagine code that exactly replicates the `for` statement
without the `for` statement.  (This is called *unrolling* the loop.)  A `for`
statement simply replicates the code inside it, but before each iteration, it
assigns a new value from the given sequence to the name we chose.  For
example, here is an unrolled version of the loop above:

```{python}
i = 0
print(i)
i = 1
print(i)
i = 2
print(i)
```

Notice that the name `i` is arbitrary, just like any name we assign with `=`.
For example, the following `for` loop works in just the same way as the `for`
loop above:

```{python}
for my_variable in np.arange(3):
    print(my_variable)
```

* `my_variable` is the *loop variable*;
* `np.arange(3)` is the *sequence*;
* `print(my_variable)` is the *body* of the loop.

As in the examples above, the body of the loop need not use the loop variable.  We might just use the loop to repeat something several times.  Here is an old-school comedy policeman:

```{python}
for i in np.arange(3):
    print("Hello")
```

* `i` is the *loop variable*;
* `np.arange(3)` is the *sequence*;
* `print("Hello")` is the *body* of the loop.  It does not use the loop
  variable.

In the next example, we use a `for` statement in a more realistic way: we
print the results of five random integers:

```{python}
for i in np.arange(5):
    print(np.random.randint(2))
```

In this case, we simply perform exactly the same (random) action several
times, so the code inside our `for` statement does not actually refer to the
variable `i`.

### Example: Counting the Number of Heads ###

We can now simulate five tosses of a coin and place the results into
an array. We will start by creating an empty array and then appending
the result of each toss.

```{python}
# An empty array.
tosses = np.array([])

for i in np.arange(5):
    tosses = np.append(tosses, np.random.randint(2))

tosses
```

Let us rewrite the cell with the `for` statement unrolled:

```{python}
# An empty array.
tosses = np.array([])

i = 0
tosses = np.append(tosses, np.random.randint(2))
i = 1
tosses = np.append(tosses, np.random.randint(2))
i = 2
tosses = np.append(tosses, np.random.randint(2))
i = 3
tosses = np.append(tosses, np.random.randint(2))
i = 4
tosses = np.append(tosses, np.random.randint(2))

tosses
```

Now we have an array, we can use `np.sum` to count the
number of heads in the five tosses.

```{python}
np.sum(tosses)
```

Iteration is a powerful technique. For example, by running exactly the
same code for 1000 tosses instead of 5, we can count the number of
heads in 1000 tosses.

```{python}
# An empty array.
tosses = np.array([])

for i in np.arange(1000):
    tosses = np.append(tosses, np.random.randint(2))

tosses
```

### Example: Number of Heads in 100 Tosses ###

It is natural to expect that in 100 tosses of a coin, there will be 50
heads, give or take a few.

But how many is "a few"? What's the chance of getting exactly 50
heads? Questions like these matter in data science not only because
they are about interesting aspects of randomness, but also because
they can be used in analyzing experiments where assignments to
treatment and control groups are decided by the toss of a coin.

In this example we will simulate 10,000 repetitions of the following
experiment:

- Toss a coin 100 times and record the number of heads.

The histogram of our results will give us some insight into how many
heads are likely.


As y'all have already seen, `np.randint` can take a `size` argument, to return an array of random integers:

```{python}
np.random.randint(2, size=10)
```

Now let's study 100 tosses. We will start by creating an empty array
called `heads`. Then, in each of the 10,000 repetitions, we will toss
a coin 100 times, count the number of heads, and append it to `heads`.

```{python}
N = 10000

head_counts = np.array([])

for i in np.arange(N):
    tosses = np.random.randint(2, size=100)
    n_heads = np.sum(tosses)
    head_counts = np.append(head_counts, n_heads)

head_counts
```

Here is a histogram of the data, with bins of width 1 centered at each
value of the number of heads.

This is the first time we have used plotting, so please accept this piece of code to initialize the plotting first:

```{python}
# Please don't worry about this bit of code for now.
# It sets up plotting in the notebook.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
# Fancy plots
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
```

Now we do the histogram:

```{python}
# Again, don't worry about the details here.
plt.hist(head_counts, bins=np.arange(30.5, 69.6, 1));
```

Not surprisingly, the histogram looks roughly symmetric around 50
heads. The height of the bar at 50 is about 8% per unit. Since each
bin is 1 unit wide, this is the same as saying that about 8% of the
repetitions produced exactly 50 heads. That's not a huge percent, but
it's the largest compared to the percent at every other number of
heads.

The histogram also shows that in almost all of the repetitions, the
number of heads in 100 tosses was somewhere between 35 and 65. Indeed,
the bulk of the repetitions produced numbers of heads in the range 45
to 55.

While in theory it is *possible* that the number of heads can be
anywhere between 0 and 100, the simulation shows that the range of
*probable* values is much smaller.

This is an instance of a more general phenomenon about the variability
in coin tossing, as we will see later in the course.

Now see [the for loop exercises](../exercises/for_loops).
