Names are given to values in Python using an *assignment* statement. In an
assignment, a name is followed by `=`, which is followed by any expression.
The value of the expression to the right of `=` is *assigned* to the name.
Once a name has a value assigned to it, the value will be substituted for that
name in future expressions.

```{python}
a = 10
b = 20
a + b
```

A previously assigned name can be used in the expression to the right of `=`.

```{python}
quarter = 1/4
half = 2 * quarter
half
```

However, only the current value of an expression is assigned to a name. If
that value changes later, names that were defined in terms of that value will
not change automatically.

```{python}
quarter = 4
half
```

Names must start with a letter, but can contain both letters and numbers. A
name cannot contain a space; instead, it is common to use an underscore
character `_` to replace each space. Names are only as useful as you make
them; it's up to the programmer to choose names that are easy to interpret.
Typically, more meaningful names can be invented than `a` and `b`. For
example, let's say you were calculating the 20% Value Added Tax for a
restaurant bill, as well as 15% tip, on top of that.  The following names
clarify the meaning of the various quantities involved.

```{python}
meal_price = 25
vat_rate = 0.2
vat = meal_price * vat_rate
meal_price_with_vat = meal_price + vat
meal_price_with_vat
```

```{python}
tip_rate = 0.15
tip = meal_price_with_vat * tip_rate
meal_price_total = meal_price_with_vat + tip
meal_price_total
```
