# The idea of permutation


## A mosquito problem

With thanks to John Rauser: [Statistics Without the Agonizing Pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dnw46eC-0o)


## The data

Download the data from [mosquito_beer.csv]({{ site.baseurl
}}/data/mosquito_beer.csv).


See [this page](https://github.com/matthew-brett/datasets/tree/master/mosquito_beer) for more details on the dataset.


```{python}
# Import Numpy library, rename as "np"
import numpy as np
# Import Pandas library, rename as "pd"
import pandas as pd

# Set up plotting
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# %matplotlib inline
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
```

```{python}
# HIDDEN
# An extra tweak to make sure we always get the same random numbers.
# Do not use this in your own code; you nearly always want an unpredictable
# stream of random numbers.  Making them predictable in this way only makes
# sense for a very limited range of things, like tutorials and tests.
np.random.seed(42)
```

Read in the data:

```{python}
mosquitoes = pd.read_csv('mosquito_beer.csv')
mosquitoes.head()
```

Filter the data frame to contain only the "after" treatment rows:

```{python}
# After treatment rows.
afters = mosquitoes[mosquitoes['test'] == 'after']
```

Filter the "after" rows to contain only the "beer" group, and get the number of activated mosquitoes for these 25 subjects:

```{python}
# After beer treatment rows.
beers = afters[afters['group'] == 'beer']
# The 'activated' numbers for the after beer rows.
beer_activated = np.array(beers['activated'])
beer_activated
```

The number of subjects in the "beer" condition:

```{python}
n_beer = len(beer_activated)
n_beer
```

Get the "activated" number for the 18 subjects in the "water" group:

```{python}
# Same for the water group.
waters = afters[afters['group'] == 'water']
water_activated = np.array(waters['activated'])
water_activated
```

Number of subjects in the "water" condition:

```{python}
n_water = len(water_activated)
n_water
```

## The permutation way


* Calculate difference in means
* Pool
* Repeat many times:
    * Shuffle
    * Split
    * Recalculate difference in means
    * Store


## On balls

Here are the activated numbers for the "beer" group (in gold), and the activated numbers for the "water" group, in blue:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/just_balls.png)


## The difference in means

Here we select only the first 25 values, which are the "beer" activated numbers:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/beer_mean.png)

The mean of these first 25 values:

```{python}
beer_mean = np.mean(beer_activated)
beer_mean
```

Next we select the last 18 values that are the activation values for the "water" subjects:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/water_mean.png)

```{python}
water_mean = np.mean(water_activated)
water_mean
```

The difference between the means in our data:

```{python}
observed_difference = beer_mean - water_mean
observed_difference
```

## Pool

Next we put these values into one long array, 25 + 18 values long.

```{python}
pooled = np.append(beer_activated, water_activated)
pooled
```

## Shuffle

Then we shuffle the pooled values so the beer and water values are completely
mixed.

```{python}
np.random.shuffle(pooled)
pooled
```

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fake_balls0.png)

## Split

We take the first 25 values as our fake beer group.  In fact of course it is a random mixture of the beer and the water values.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fake_beer_mean0.png)

We calculate the mean:

```{python}
fake_beer = pooled[:n_beer]
fake_beer_mean = np.mean(fake_beer)
fake_beer_mean
```

Then we take the last 18 values as our fake water group:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fake_water_mean0.png)

```{python}
fake_water = pooled[n_beer:]
fake_water_mean = np.mean(fake_water)
fake_water_mean
```

The difference between these means is our first estimate of how much the mean difference will vary when we take random samples:

```{python}
fake_diff = fake_beer_mean - fake_water_mean
fake_diff
```

## And again

Anther shuffle:

```{python}
np.random.shuffle(pooled)
```

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fake_beer_mean1.png)

Another fake beer group, and a fake beer mean:

```{python}
fake_beer = pooled[:n_beer]
np.mean(fake_beer)
```

Another fake water group, and its mean:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fake_water_mean1.png)

```{python}
fake_water = pooled[n_beer:]
np.mean(fake_water)
```

Another difference between these means:

```{python}
np.mean(fake_beer) - np.mean(fake_water)
```

We can keep on repeating this process to get more and more examples of mean
differences:

```{python}
# Shuffle
np.random.shuffle(pooled)
# Split
fake_beer = pooled[:n_beer]
fake_water = pooled[n_beer:]
# Recalculate mean difference
fake_diff = np.mean(fake_beer) - np.mean(fake_water)
fake_diff
```

We can do this as many times as we want, using a `for` loop:


```{python}
fake_differences = np.zeros(10000)
for i in np.arange(10000):
    # Shuffle
    np.random.shuffle(pooled)
    # Split
    fake_beer = pooled[:n_beer]
    fake_water = pooled[n_beer:]
    # Recalculate mean difference
    fake_diff = np.mean(fake_beer) - np.mean(fake_water)
    # Store mean difference
    fake_differences[i] = fake_diff
plt.hist(fake_differences);
```

We are interested to know just how unusual it is to get a difference as big as we actually see, in these many samples of differences we expect by chance, from random sampling.

We do this by calculating how many of the fake differences we generated are equal to or greater than the difference we observe:

```{python}
n_ge_actual = np.count_nonzero(fake_differences >= observed_difference)
n_ge_actual
```

That means that the chance of any one difference being greater than the one we observe is:

```{python}
p_ge_actual = n_ge_actual / 10000
p_ge_actual
```

This is also an estimate of the probability we would see a difference as large as the one we observe, if we were taking random samples from a matching population.
