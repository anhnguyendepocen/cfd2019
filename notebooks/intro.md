# The Textbooks with Jupyter and Jekyll demo

This is a short demonstration textbook to show the general layout / style of textbooks built
with Jupyter and Jekyll. Remember that the content itself lives in Jupyter Notebooks (in the `notebooks/` folder
of the repository). The markdown files for *this* page (and others in the textbook) is generated from the notebooks
with the `scripts/generate_textbook.py` script.

To begin, click on one of the chapter sections in the sidebar to the left. The first section demonstrates some
simple functionality of this repository, while the following chapters contain a subset of content from the
[Data 8 textbook](https://inferentialthinking.com).
