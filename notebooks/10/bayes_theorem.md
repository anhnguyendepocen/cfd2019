The [reverse probability page](first_bayes) has a game, that we analyzed by simulation, and then by reflection.

The game is:

* I have two boxes; *box4* with 4 red balls and 1 green ball, and *box2* with
  two red balls and three green balls.
* I offer you one of these two boxes at random, without telling you which.
* You draw a ball at random from the box, and you get a red ball.
* What is the probability that I gave you box4?

We found by simulation, and later by reflection, that the probability is 0.67.

The logic we discovered was:

* We want the proportion of "red" trials that came from box4.
* Calculate the proportion of trials that are *both* box4 and red, and divide
  by the overall proportion of red trials.
* The proportion of red trials that are *both* box4 *and* red is the
  proportion of box4 trials multiplied by (the proportion of box4 trials that
  are red).

This logic is a fundamental rule in probability called [Bayes
theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem).

In this page, we relate the logic above to the usual way of describing Bayes
theorem.

First we need some notation.

The probability that I give you *box4* on any one trial is 0.5.

I write this as:

$$
P(box4) = 0.5
$$

Read this as "the probability of *box4* is 0.5".

Similarly:

$$
P(box2) = 0.5
$$

The probability of getting a red ball, given that I am drawing from *box4*, is 4/5 = 0.8.  We write "given" here with the bar: $\mid$.

$$
P(red \mid box4) = 0.8
$$

Read this as "the probability of drawing a red ball given I have box4 is 0.8".

Similarly:

$$
P(red \mid box2) = 0.4
$$

Sometimes we want to express the probability of two things happening together.  For example, we might want to express the probability that I gave you box4 *and* I drew a red.  We write that like this:

$$
P(box4 \cap red)
$$

Read this as "the probability of getting box4 *and* drawing a red ball".

We follow the logic above, with this notation.  Here is the logic again:

1. We want the proportion of "red" trials that came from box4.
2. Calculate the proportion of trials that are *both* box4 and red, and divide
   by the overall proportion of red trials.
3. The proportion of red trials that are *both* box4 *and* red is the
   proportion of box4 trials multiplied by (the proportion of box4 trials that
   are red).

We can express the first statement by saying that we are trying to find
$P(box4 \mid red)$.

We can express the third statement in the following way.  We use the $\cap$
symbol to express "and".

$$
P(box4 \cap red) = P(box4) P(red \mid box4)
$$

Read this statement as "the probability that we got box4 *and* drew a red ball
is equal to the probability that we got box4, multiplied by the probability
that we draw a red ball given we got box4".  As we know, in our case, $P(box4
\cap red)$ is 0.5 * 0.8 = 0.4.

The second statement says:

$$
foo
$$

Remember from the [reverse probability page](first_bayes) that we found
$P(red)$ by adding the probabilities of the two different ways we can get
a red ball: $P(red) = P(red | box4) + P(red | box2)$.

Putting the first, third and second statements together into one, we get:

$$
P(box4 \mid red) = \frac{P(box4) P(red \mid box4)}{P(red)}
$$

This is Bayes theorem, although it is usually written with the multiplication in the other order:

$$
P(box4 \mid red) = \frac{P(red \mid box4) P(box4)}{P(red)}
$$
