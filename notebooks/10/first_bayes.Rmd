In the [problem for the education minister]({{ site.baseurl
}}/chapters/10/havana_math) we had a sample of fast-track-marked exams from
2019, and we found that the mean mark was about 65.3.  We wondered what we
could say about the eventual  when we have the marks for all 8000 or so
students.

For example, we might wonder how likely it is that the eventual mean will be
near 65.3, as it was in 2018.  Or we might wonder whether we could be say that
the eventual mean for all the papers will be the sample mean --- 54.5 --- plus
or minus a bit.   If so, what value should we give to "a bit"?

This kind of problem can be called a problem of *reverse probability*.

We first start with *forward* probability, where we ask questions like this:
what is the probability of seeing a mean around 54.5 if the population mean is
actually 65.3?  Then we go in *reverse* to ask questions like: what is the
probability that the population mean is around 65.3 given the sample mean of
54.5.


## A reverse probability game


Imagine I offer you one of two boxes.

One box has four red balls and one green ball.  Call this 'box4'.

The other box has two red balls and three green balls.  Call this 'box2'.

I haven't told you which box I gave you, but I do tell you that I chose the
box at random, so you have a 50% chance that I gave you 'box4' and a 50%
chance I gave you 'box2'.

Now let's say that you shake the box to shuffle the balls, then close your
eyes, and take out one ball.  You open your eyes to find you have a red ball.

What is the chance that I gave you 'box4'?

Notice that this is *reverse probability* problem.  You are working back from what you see (the red ball) to what I gave you.

In our exam mark problem, we are working back from what we saw (the sample
mean of 54.5) to the eventual mean for all the exams.

How are we going to solve the box4, box2 reverse probability problem?
Simulation!

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# %matplotlib inline
```

```{python}
# Make a box with 4 red balls and 1 green ball
box4 = np.repeat(['red', 'green'], [4, 1])
box4
```

```{python}
# Make a box with 2 red balls and 3 green balls
box2 = np.repeat(['red', 'green'], [2, 3])
box2
```

Now we make 10000 trials, where we:

* Choose box2 or box4 at random;
* Choose a ball at random from the resulting box.

```{python}
n_iters = 10000
box_nos = np.repeat([1], n_iters)
ball_colors = np.repeat(['green'], n_iters)
for i in np.arange(n_iters):
    # Choose a box number randomly from box4, box2.
    box_no = np.random.choice([4, 2])
    # Choose a ball at random from the box.
    if box_no == 4:
        # Choose a ball at random from box4.
        ball_color = np.random.choice(box4)
    else:  # box 4
        # Choose a ball at random from box2.
        ball_color = np.random.choice(box2)
    # Store the results.
    box_nos[i] = box_no
    ball_colors[i] = ball_color
```

Last we put the results into a data frame for convenience:

```{python}
# Make these into a data frame.
trial_results = pd.DataFrame()
trial_results['box no'] = box_nos
trial_results['ball color'] = ball_colors
trial_results.head()
```

Now we can see the proportion of trials on which we got a red ball, where the box we had got was box4.

```{python}
# Of the trials giving a red ball, what proportion came from box 4?
red_ball_trials = trial_results[trial_results['ball color'] == 'red']
p_box4 = np.count_nonzero(red_ball_trials['box no'] == 4) / len(red_ball_trials)
p_box4
```

Of the trials giving a red ball about 66% came from box4.   If we see a red ball, there is a 66% chance we have sampled from box4.

You have just solved your first problem in reverse probability.  The problem
will soon reveal a simple calculation in probability called [Bayes
theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem).

This is a fundamental building block, so let's go back over the simulation, to think about why we got this number.

We can think of all these trials as coming about from a branching tree.

At the first branching point, we split into two branches, each of width 0.5,
one for box4 and one for box2.  Thus, about 50% of the trials are "box4"
trials, and around 50% are "box2" trials:

```{python}
box4_trials = trial_results[trial_results['box no'] == 4]
box2_trials = trial_results[trial_results['box no'] == 2]
n_trials = len(trial_results)
print('Box4 proportion', len(box4_trials) / n_trials)
print('Box2 proportion', len(box2_trials) / n_trials)
```

At the second branching point, each branch splits into two.

* The box4 branch splits into a "red" branch, which carries 4/5 (0.8, 80%) of
  the box4 trials, and a "green" branch, that carries 1/5 (0.2, 20%) of the
  box4 trials, because the probability of getting a red ball from box4 is 4 in
  5.
* The box2 branch splits into a "red" branch, which carries 2/5 (0.4, 40%) of
  the box2 trials, and a "green" branch, which carries 3/5 (0.6, 60%) of the
  box2 trials, because the probability of getting a red ball from box2 is 2 in
  5.

Thus the proportion of trials that are *both* from box4 *and* give a red ball
is 0.5 (the width of the box4 branch) * 0.8 (the proportion of box4 trials
that give red) = 0.4.

```{python}
box4_and_red = box4_trials[box4_trials['ball color'] == 'red']
prop_box4_and_red = len(box4_and_red) / n_trials
print('Box4 and red proportion', prop_box4_and_red)
```

The proportion of trials that are *both* from box2 *and* give a red ball
is 0.5 (the width of the box2 branch) * 0.4 (the proportion of box2 trials
that give red) = 0.2.

```{python}
box2_and_red = box2_trials[box2_trials['ball color'] == 'red']
prop_box2_and_red = len(box2_and_red) / n_trials
print('Box2 and red proportion', prop_box2_and_red)
```

We get the overall proportion of red by adding the proportion that is box4 *and* red to the proportion that is box2 *and* red, because these are all the red trials.  This is 0.4 + 0.2 = 0.6.

```{python}
n_red = len(box4_and_red) + len(box2_and_red)
prop_red = n_red / n_trials
print('Overall proportion of red', prop_red)
```

We've already discovered about that 0.4 (40%) of all trials are box4 *and* red.  So the proportion of *all* red trials, that are box4 *and* red, is 0.4 / 0.6 = 0.666.

```{python}
print('Proportion of all red trials that are box4', (prop_box4_and_red / prop_red))
```

To go over the logic again:

* We want the proportion of "red" trials that came from box4.
* To do this, we calculate the proportion of trials that are *both* box4 and
  red, and divide by the overall proportion of red trials.
* The proportion of red trials that are *both* box4 *and* red is the
  proportion of box4 trials multiplied by (the proportion of box4 trials that
  are red).

We have just [discovered Bayes theorem]({{ site.baseurl
