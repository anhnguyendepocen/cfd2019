# What is data science?

The question sounds simple - *what is data science?* - but it has proved hard
to answer.

Here is our definition:

> Data science is a modern approach to data analysis with a foundation in code
> and algorithms.

Because it is a hard question with many answers, this page spends some time
discussing why we have this definition, instead of another.

## Data science is important

> ... academic institutions should encourage the development of a basic
> understanding of data science in all undergraduates -- A 2018 report from
> the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.

## Data science is very important

> ... the really important intellectual event of the next fifty years"
> -- Donoho (2015) "50 years of data science".
