# Textbooks with Jupyter and Jekyll

This repository / website is a template for hosting your own textbook using
Jekyll and Jupyter Notebooks. All course content is written in markdown and
Jupyter Notebooks, and a set of helper scripts converts these notebooks into
Jekyll-based markdown fit for hosting on the web. This short guide will
help you through the process should you want to do this for your own textbook.
