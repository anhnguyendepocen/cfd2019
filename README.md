# Textbooks with Jupyter and Jekyll

This repository / website is a template for hosting your own textbook using
Jupyter Notebooks and Jekyll.

Here are some highlights:

* All course content is written in markdown and Jupyter Notebooks, stored in `notebooks/`
* This site comes packaged with helper scripts to convert these into Jekyll pages (in `scripts/`)
* Pages can have [Binder](https://mybinder.org) or JupyterHub instances automatically added to allow for interactivity.
* The website itself is based on Jekyll, and is highly extensible and can be freely-hosted on GitHub.

This repository comes with some sample textbook files from the Data 8 course
for Data Science at UC Berkeley. You can update these materials and all site
content with your own, and have a Jupyter-based textbook ready to go shortly!
