These are some notes about the datasets contained in the Data Science for Everyone course.

## gender_stats.csv

This dataset is a subset of a larger dataset from the World Bank
on gender and inequality:
<https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/gender-statistics>.

The subset is a selection of variables for every country. For
each variable, we have taken the mean of all available values
from 2012 through 2016.

See the `notes` directory of the source repository for the
notebooks that generate the data from the original dataset.
