# Project

## Teams

*   Teams of size 3 or 4.
*   If you are from Maths, Physics, Computer Science or Engineering,
    you are a Theory Person.
*   If you are from Geography, Biosciences, Sports / Exercise,
    Psychology, History, English, Music or Business, you are a Data
    Person.
*   If you're in neither group, ask me (Matthew).
*   Each team must have at least one Theory person and one Data
    person.
*   See below for data rules.
*   When you have a team you're happy with, choose one member to
    email me (Matthew) with the team members, a justification for the
    fit with the rules above, and your provisional proposal for a data
    set.

## Data

*   Prefer open data - data that can be freely downloaded, preferably
    with an open license, allowing you to share the data freely.
*   Prefer data for which your Data person has some background.
*   Prefer open-ended questions.
*   Fresh data and / or analysis.
*   We will make allowance for your ambition in marking.

## Process

*   Analysis and collaboration will be public (using
    [Github](https://github.com) service).
*   Analysis should be reproducible.
*   Final report should be in the form of a Notebook, or similar
    executable document.

## Marking

Full rubric will follow soon.  In summary:

*   project marked for clarity, depth, validity and reproducibility.
*   each member of the project submits a summary of their own
    contribution, with evidence from the public record of
    collaboration.
