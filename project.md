# Project

## Teams

*   Teams of size 3 or 4.
*   If you are from Maths, Physics, Computer Science or Engineering,
    you are a Theory Person.
*   If you are from Geography, Biosciences, Sports / Exercise,
    Psychology, History, English, Music or Business, you are a Data
    Person.
*   If you're in neither group, ask me (Matthew).
*   Each team must have at least one Theory person and one Data
    person.
*   See below for data rules.
*   When you have a team you're happy with, choose one member to
    email me (Matthew), with the information below.

I will consider smaller team sizes, and even team sizes of 1, but your email
should give convincing justification (see below).  In particular, you need to
convince me you have done the best you can to form a larger team.

## Team request

Email me (Matthew) with your request to form a team.

One team member should email, with a Cc to the other members.

Your email should have:

* a list of the team members;
* note the "data" team member(s) and their subject(s).  If you don't have
  a "data" team member, give good grounds for not having one;
* note the "theory" team member(s) and their subject(s).  If you don't have one,
  give good grounds for not having one;
* point to the data you are going to use.  You must point to some initial data.
  If the data is not public, give me some way to verify that it exists, and is
  suitable;
* sketch your plan for the initial analysis, and the final results that you
  hope for.

## Data

See [data for projects](projects/data)

## Process

*   Analysis and collaboration will be public (using
    [Github](https://github.com) service).
*   Analysis should be reproducible.
*   Final report should be in the form of a Notebook, or similar
    executable document.

## Marking

Full rubric will follow soon.  In summary:

*   project marked for clarity, depth, validity and reproducibility.
*   each member of the project submits a summary of their own
    contribution, with evidence from the public record of
    collaboration.
