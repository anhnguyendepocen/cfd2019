# Observations, experiments and inference

We take a change in tack this week.

Go over to the Berkeley textbook, and read the chapter on Causality
and Experiments:
<https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/02/causality-and-experiments>

Read the whole chapter, all the way through to the [Endnote](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/02/5/endnote).

It tells the horrible and fascinating history of one of the great
medical breakthroughs - the discovery of the cause of cholera. This is the basis for a discussion of how to use data to look at causes, and how you can be deceived if you have the wrong data.

When you have read the chapter, download this [this
notebook](assignment_6.ipynb), and fill in the answers, in the
notebook text cells.
