# Assignment 3


For this assignment, you will need the information in:

* [Expressions](https://matthew-brett.github.io/dsfe/chapters/02/Expressions)
* [Names](https://matthew-brett.github.io/dsfe/chapters/02/Names).


Don't forget to execute the cells in the notebook, that I've written for you.


## Comments


In what follows, you will see me using *comments*.  Comments start with a hash character - `#`.  Python ignores everything after the hash character.  This is useful to write text for you or others to read, inside your code.

```{python active="", eval=FALSE}
For example, try executing the following cell.
```

```{python}
# This is just a comment.  Python ignores it.  It's just for show.
```

Nothing happens - Python ignored everything after the hash character.


## The problem


The problem is my bank.

I have a credit card debt of Â£500.

Let's give that debt amount, a *name*:

```{python}
# This is the amount I owe at the moment
my_debt = 500
```

At the moment, the bank is nice enough to charge me 10% interest per year.   Let's give that a name too.

```{python}
interest_rate = 0.1
```

The amount of interest, after one year, is therefore:

```{python}
interest = my_debt * interest_rate
interest
```

Then my total new debt will be:

```{python}
my_debt + interest
```

I can also calculate my total new debt all in one go by multiplying by `1 + interest_rate` - in my case - `1.1`.

```{python}
debt_increaser = 1 + interest_rate
debt_increaser
```

```{python}
my_debt * debt_increaser
```

## Now your turn


Add your code to the cell below, and execute it, to show my total debt after two years.  Your code will probably start with:

```
my_debt * debt_increaser
```

```{python}
# Show my debt after two years.
# Your code below this comment
```

Fill in the next cell, in the same way, to show my debt after three years.

```{python}
# Show my debt after three years.
```

Now show my debt after 10 years.   You might want to use the *power* operator `**` to do this.

```{python}
# Show my debt after ten years.
```

## An offer from the bank


The bank has just sent me a nice letter explaining that they are going to start charging me interest every week instead of every year.   They value me as a customer, so, instead of dividing the annual interest rate by 52, they are going to divide it by 53 instead.   But - is that a good offer?


Here is their proposed weekly interest rate:

```{python}
weekly_interest_rate = interest_rate / 53
weekly_interest_rate
```

That corresponds to:

```{python}
weekly_debt_increaser = 1 + weekly_interest_rate
weekly_debt_increaser
```

So, starting from my original debt, I will owe this much after one week:

```{python}
# What I owe, after one week, on the new deal
my_debt * weekly_debt_increaser
```

Fill in the cell below, to show how much I will owe after 52 weeks.  You will probably want `**` here again.

```{python}
# Show my debt after 52 weeks, on the new deal
```

## For extra cool points


Can you calculate roughly what the weekly interest rate has to be, in order to correspond to the 10% annual interest that I started with?   There are several ways to do this, but you can try trial and error, if you like.

```{python}
# Your code to estimate the right weekly interest rate.
```
